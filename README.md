## Why?
I decided to move Nino's API to a different repository so no overhead of requests are correlated to the bot.
Since Node.js is single-threaded, I decided to not run an API and the bot at the same time and having an API implemented
in the bot *could be* "optional" but, I decided not to, which was the original plan on the rewrite (v0 -> v1).

## Self-hosting
Before we run this API, I recommend not to. Since builds are most likely unstable, it's not really recommended to Nino and private instances
don't need this type of functionality...

### Prerequisites
Before running your instance of **API**, you will need the following tools before starting:

- [**Redis** v6.2+](https://redis.io) - Used for cache with the bot and **API**.
- [**Git** v2.31+](https://git-scm.com/) - Useful for retrieving new updates with **API**.
- [**Go** v1.16+](https://go.dev) - Language utilities + build-tools to run **API**

## Building
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/NinoDiscord/API.git && cd API
$ go get && go build
```
